Hello, this is a simple classes structure that has been created in a Java programming curse with alura courses.
For looking at the content you should go to the folder "src" and:
in "Calculos" folder you will find interfaces and calculators used in the clases, by the way, the folder 
"Modelos" has the main class "Titulo" and the main class "Principal".
